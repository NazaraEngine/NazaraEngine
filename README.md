# Nazara Engine  

Nazara Engine is a cross-platform framework aimed at (but not limited to) real-time applications requiring audio, 2D and 3D rendering, network and more (such as video games).

Features:
- 2D and 3D rendering using either Vulkan, OpenGL and OpenGL ES (depending on what's available on the target system).
- Its own renderer-agnostic shader language (NZSL - Nazara Shading Language), no need to write specialized GLSL code anymore!
- Easy to customize graphics module providing basis for advanced techniques (such as deferred shading, HDR, PBR rendering and more).
- Audio playback and streaming based on OpenAL.
- 2D and 3D Physics integration (with [Chipmunk](https://chipmunk-physics.net) and [Newton Dynamics](https://github.com/MADEAPPS/newton-dynamics)).
- Optional ECS (Entity-Component-System) classes for helping with entity handling (based on the excellent [entt](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)).
- A [ENet](https://github.com/lsalzman/enet)-based reliable UDP networking protocol.

You can use it in any kind of commercial and non-commercial applications without any restriction ([MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)).
