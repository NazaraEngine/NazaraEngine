These files are the result of reconstructing a set of range images
using the "vrip" program.  The first file is the high resolution
result, while the "_res*" files are decimated versions.  Note that
these decimations were performed using a crude algorithm that does not
necessarily preserve mesh topology.  While they are not beautiful,
they are suitable for interactive rendering.

Note that this model is a decimated version of the original which was
constructed at the voxel resolution of 0.35 mm.  The original model
has no holes in it, however, the decimated model has some holes that
we detected with software, but not by inspection.  Apparently, the
decimation software introduced these holes.
